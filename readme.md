# Trans-Dimensional Generative Modeling via Jump Diffusion Models

![Visualization of molecule generation process, with atoms being created and being denoised simultaneously.](molecules/assets/image_genprog.png "Visualization of Generation Process")

This repository contains the code for our paper introducing jump diffusions for modeling varying dimensional data.

We include notebooks for visualizing molecule samples and interpolations as well as code for our video models. Pretrained models are also provided for our molecule and video models.
